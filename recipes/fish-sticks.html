    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These baked homemade fish sticks served with tartar sauce come out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. You can use cod, halibut, or catfish fillets.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>White fish</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Old Bay seasoning</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or use a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li>Blot fish dry with paper towels. Season fish with salt and pepper. Cut filets crosswise in 1-inch strips.</li>
        <li>Combine panko and Old Bay seasoning in a shallow dish. Beat together egg and water in a second shallow dish. Place flour in a third shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Dip fish pieces in flour to coat, shaking off excess, then in egg mixture, then in panko. Place breaded fish sticks on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Coat fish sticks generously with cooking spray. Bake freshly breaded or frozen fish sticks until golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes, turning once halfway through baking time.</li>
        <li>For Tartar Sauce, in a small bowl whisk together mayonnaise, pickle relish, onion, dill weed, capers (if using), and lemon juice. Chill at least 2 hours before serving and up to 1 week.</li>
        <li>Serve fish sticks with Tartar Sauce and lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
